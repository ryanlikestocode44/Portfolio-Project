    <p>My name is Ryan Nicholas Purba. I live in Indonesia, in West Java Province. I am an university student at Gunadarma University since 2021. I am a simple and ambitious person. I have taken Web Development journey since the end of 2021 because I got motivated from my friend who already made his own website, I asked him what he did and what tools he used, and now I got a glimpse about Web Development. Before I joined online courses, I decided to learn it through YouTube. The first thing I learned was HTML, and then CSS to styling it, and a little bit understanding about JavaScript. But, throught the days I'm still struggled at JavaScript so I ended up making HTML and CSS website only more and more. You can check my website that I already build in my GitHub Repository <a href="https://github.com/ryanlikestocode44/Projects">here.</a></p>

    <p>Other than Web Development, I also like to build 3D Mesh Modelling with Blender for Roblox Game. Currently, I am still working for one of the Roblox Groups. I also have some hobbies such as Playing Games such as Roblox and JoJo Game, Playing Guitar, and Drawing. And now I want to make Coding to be my new hobby and my new daily habit, because I want to change my life from just playing game on my laptop to build something useful and can be shared to everyone else</p>
